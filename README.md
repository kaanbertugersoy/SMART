**Status: Archived – No Longer Maintained**

SMART (Stock Market Analysis and Research Tools) was an exploratory project aimed at developing tools for comprehensive stock market analysis. The goal was to integrate various analytical components to assist in investment research and decision-making.

## Project Overview

The envisioned capabilities of SMART included:

- **Balance Sheet Analysis**: Calculating real expected growth and assessing how this growth is reflected in stock prices.
- **Regression/Classification**: Training neural networks on market data for trading/backtesting purposes.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Bayesian optimization for selecting better hyperparams.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Finding the feature weights that mostly contribute to training. 

Proposed scoring metrics:

- **Growth Consistency**
