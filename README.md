Timeseries Analysis Tools
=========================

If you see someone predicting prices rather than returns then you should
immediately stop following him. (This is an illusion and no use of trading
and investing.)

What will be SMART able to do:

- Balance Sheet Analysis (Calculating Real Expected Growth and the Reflection
  ratio of this growth to price)
- News Analysis (Logical Reasoning)
- Global Collapses (oppurtinities)
- Unreasonable movements (unknown actions taken by big investers (gambles))
- Sectoral Trends Detection

Scores i want to add:

- Growth Consistancy (+)
- Profit Consistancy
- OverBougth or Oversold
- Sectoral Popularity Score

If the stock price follows random walk, best guess for the next price is
just the previous value, we can not do any better than this

what i want to monitor for each model evaluation:

- Onestep, multistep, multioutput differences (+)
- Comparison with a dummy model for exp.(Random Walk) (+)
- How affects using different features
- How the performance change from using 'changes' rather than continuing
  data !! CRITIC
